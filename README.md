# ShoppingList
 
This shopping list was made while using Zero To Masterys Complete Web Developer 2023 course. This exercise was done as part of the "DOM Manipulation" module.

# Features
 * Allow the user to add new items to the list
 * Detect when a user has clicked on an item and cross off or bring back an item
 * Allow the user to delete individual items from the list

# Main Focus
The focus of this project is to expand my knowledge of Javascript and how to manipulate by accessing, adding and modifying elements inside of the DOM.
